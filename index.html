   <h2>Intro:</h2>
   <p class="paragraph">
                            We must admit, the last time we picked up a worm was probably as a kid playing in the
garden making mud pies. But even though we don't really see them, but beneath our feet, the
Earth is teeming with these <b>subterranean annelids</b>.
        <br>And while they're not exactly glamorous, but they
have the power to engineer entire ecosystems. 
<br> 
            <br>While being fascinated by the humble earthworm, We find some pretty
excellent company.
 Back in 1881, none other than the great Charles Darwin published his last scientific book <b> <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1357&pageseq=1"> <b>The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms</b></a> </b>, which was devoted to the behaviour and ecology of earthworms.

            <h2>Darwin's plough</h2>
            <p>
                Earthworms are sometimes referred to as Darwin's plough and this is because of their natural activities in the soil.

They bring mineral soil up to the surface and they take organic matter down into the soil to act as food for themselves.

<br> By doing, they actually mix the soil layers.

And by passing the soil through their gut, they create a good quality crumb structure to the soil, which is great for growing plants.
         </p>
            <h2>Ecosystem Engineers</h2>
        <p>
            It's difficult to think of earthworms. pink, fleshy, squishy things, as a force of nature.
            <br>Earthworms are considered to be <b>ecosystem engineers</b>, because they change the very nature of the material that they're living within.

           <strong> <br> <br> <em>So how that helps to improve the quality of soil and how it changes the soil?</em></strong> 
        <br><details>
        <p>
                The type of worms that live in organic matter, are taking that very raw material, usually waste vegetable, plant material, dung and they're passing it through their gut, and within their gut, there are microbes that act upon that material plus their own digestive enzymes, and they
change the nature of that material and make it more available and usable by other organism within the soil.
                But also they change it chemically so that it becomes more available to other organisms.
        </p>
        </details>
        <h2 id="nitrogen">Need Of Nitrogen</h2>
        <p class="pnitrogen">
            By being active in the soil, what they do is, that they increase the availability of nutrients for instance, nitrogen. 
        <br>Nitrogen is really essential for all living things, but also for plants. So to increase the availability of nitrogen for plant uptake. <br>
        <br>You might be <i>wondering!!</i> something here. <br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  Nitrogen makes up about <b>78%</b> of the air in our atmosphere.
<em>So why do plants need help from earthworms to get hold of it? </em>  

 Well, pure nitrogen in the form of a gas is pretty inert <sup>chemically inactive</sup> and isn't much useful to living things.
 <br> It has to be converted into other forms by bacteria, first into nutrients like <b>ammonium</b> and then into <b>nitrates</b> and <b>nitrites.</b>

In this form of nitrogen that plants can make use of to grow. 

Earthworms seem to speed up this process by their action in the soil, making more nitrogen available for the plants to use. <br>
    <details>
        <P class="pnitrogen">
            If you use inorganic fertilisers, which include nitrogen then it's already fertilised in a way that plants can take it up immediately or very fast. <br>

So if you are an organic farmer and you use organic fertilisers or you leave the crop residues out of your land, then the earthworms they eat it, they mix it into the soil, and in this way, make the nitrogen available to the plants. <br>

And that's a slower process. But also, the effect of earthworms is used to a maximum really. <br>

<br> Artificial fertilisers are great for boosting plant growth quickly, but they can also cause <b>nitrogen pollution</b> when they leach into water systems, disrupting natural ecosystems and they can make soil less healthy in the long run. <br>

Using earthworms to help fertilise soil is slower, but they can boost yields by up to <b>25 percent</b>, and they have the greatest effect when the nitrogen availability is already low. 

<br> So they could help organic farmers like me to increase crop yields in the absence of artificial fertilisers while being kinder to the environment. 

<br> But it doesn't stop there. In fact, if farmers leave their crop residues on their fields after harvesting, the earthworms can actually help to lock up carbon in the soil.

<br> It's said that earthworms can store carbon in the soil and they are supposed to be able to do this by just feeding themselves with litter and mixing this litter. 

<br> So, I mean, that's plant remains, they mix that with mineral particles in the soil and excrete that as their poo (earthworm poo), and within these excrete, the carbon is less available for microbial decomposition, which would mean in the end that there's less co2 coming out of the soil.

        <h2>Horizontal Burrowing Worms</h2>
        <p>
            Horizontal burrowing worms, the ones that live just below the soil surface are <b>geophagus</b> , they eat their way through the soil. 
            <br> So what they're doing is utilising organic material that is found within the soil that's been brought down into the soil,
             and then mixing it with the mineral soil, actually creating a better physical and chemical structure to the soil that then is much more available to plants.
        </p>
        <h2>Deep Burrowing Earthworms</h2>
        <p>
            The deep burrowing earthworms provide lots of ecosystem services in the soil, they produce what are called <b>macro pores</b>, large holes in the soil, extending down a metre, perhaps down to three metres at a time. 

<br> This allows water to enter the soil. This allows air oxygen to enter the soil, and so improves the quality of the plants that are living there. 

<br>In addition, of course, as they feed, they gather organic material from the soil surface, things like dead leaves, and they drag that down intotheir burrows. 

<br>And by doing so, they increase the fertility of the soil and make that material available to the other types of earthworms the ones that live just below the soil surface.

<h2 id="conclusion">CONSCLUSION</h2>
        <p>
            But it's not just farmers that this is relevant for, this is something that could potentially affect all of us. <br>

As our global population rocket towards 8 billion people, we're going to need to find ways to feed more hungry mouths, while at the same time reducing our impact on the environment.
